# About AIAU

Here at AIAU we are striving for a better world. We believe that the things we make today can impact you and future generations. We think we can change the world for the better though technology. 

Our main project, Project: A.R.B.I.S, is an attempt towards an AI that will help you manage your computer, time and life more efficently and effectively. Our aim is to have the AI able to manage as much or as little as you want. You could have it manage your mail and calander, reminding you of special dates and remembering notes, or you could have it send you a message that you left the lights on at home. You could then proceed to turn them off with a touch of a button. 

This is our vision for Project: A.R.B.I.S. 

We want you to be there when we achive this.
