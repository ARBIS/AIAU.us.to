## A.R.B.I.S. Development

Hint: If you're not sure who to email, email A.R.B.I.S. Development, as it doubles as our support team.

Contact our development team for A.R.B.I.S. at [contact@aiau.us.to](mailto:contact@aiau.us.to), we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!

## Website Development

Note: If you have an issue with this website please [file an issue on GitHub here](https://github.com/ARBIS/AIAU.us.to/issues) instead, as it will allow us to find and fix the problem sooner!

Contact the developer for this website at [jonah@aiau.us.to](mailto:jonah@aiau.us.to). 

## Corporate

Warning: Please contact corporate for business/legal topics only. All support questions sent here will be automatically deleted.

## Additional Notes

Please contact the correct department so we can reply as soon as possible with an appropriate response. If in doubt contact the A.R.B.I.S. development team, as they also function as support. Corporate should only be contacted to discuss business/legal topics. If you have an issue with this website you are encouraged to fill out an issue [here](https://github.com/ARBIS/AIAU.us.to/issues), rather than contacting our web developer by email.
